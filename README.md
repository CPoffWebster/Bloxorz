# Bloxorz

This project supports solving any bloxorz puzzle (as found: https://www.miniclip.com/games/bloxorz/en/). 
The only only exception being it does not support puzzles with X/O plots and changing floors.
(i.e. only supports boards with a unchangeable base).

Multiple different algorithms were run on bloxorz. Ultimately BFSMultiPruneSearcher is the most efficient.
