# Bloxorz
Project created in CS210 - Artificial Intelligence

This project supports solving any bloxorz puzzle (as found: https://www.miniclip.com/games/bloxorz/en/). 
The only only exception being it does not support puzzles with X/O plots and changing floors.
(i.e. only supports boards with a unchangeable base).

Multiple different algorithms were run on bloxorz. Ultimately BFSMultiPruneSearcher is the most efficient.



Project was not entirely created by me and parts were provided by my professor:

in bloxorz - next_position was created
in bloxorz_problem - everything that isn't a test was created
BFSMultiPruneSearcher - created
BidirectionalSearcher - created
BFSSearcher - created
display - altered to test different algorithms

All other files were provided in order to help run bloxorz puzzles
